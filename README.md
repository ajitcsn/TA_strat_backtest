## RSI, MACD, Candle, Volume Backtested Strategy
**This project consists of 4 sections:**
1) Set up and importing data
2) Coding and running technical indicators
3) Defining and coding buy and sell signals
4) Results

### 1. Setup and Importing Data
1) Data is obtained from nsepy, but yfinance can also be used.
2) We use numpy, pandas, matplotlib since these are the standard data manipulation and visualization tools.
3) Candlestick charts generated by plotly
4) Some technical indicators generated by pandas_ta

### 2. Coding and running technical indicators
Indicators used:

a) Shooting star  
b) Bullish Marubozu  
c) Bearish Marubozu
2) Technical Indicators  
a) MACD  
b) RSI  
c) Volume (It is already present in the data from nsepy)

### 3. Defining and coding buy and sell signals
**Buy signals:**

We will go long if
1) Bullish MACD crossover occurs  
2) RSI is in our favour

We will increase our investment if volume increases drastically while the market is still moving in our favour

**Sell signals:**

We will short if

1) Bearish MACD crossover occurs  
2) RSI is in our favour

We will short more if volume increases drastically while the market is still moving in our favour

**Costs:**
Transaction costs: 0.03%

### 4. Results
**Black** is return without using any strategy (just buying and holding)
**Red** is return with the strategy
